## BullyHunter  

### Description:  
Bullying is very common in educational institutions and could lead to low self confidence, anxiety, depression and emotional instability in students. There are many cases where it has led to suicides or even worse, mass shootings.  
So the idea is to train a machine learning model to identify bullying scenarios and notify the authorities of the situation.  

### Goals:  
    1. Perform speech analysis on data ( obtained by placing microphones in hallways ) and identify bullying scenarios  
    2. Notify the authorities of the situation ( on mobile app and slack)  
    3. Identify the bully and the victim to keep record  
    4. Send exact location details to the authority to send help
