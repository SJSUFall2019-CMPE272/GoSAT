## SaveMo.

Description:
Money management is an essential skill for everyone, yet many people are still unable to manage their expenses efficiently. We aim to provide a classification model that will track positive and negative user spending habits.


Goals:

    1. To make a model that can suggest based on the tracking details, different ways to save money. 
    
    2. Using the receipt track the money of the user hard cash. Also to read usersâ€™ phone notification to track their digital payments.
    
    3. To produce real time review of their spending. And give a red, yellow or green flag, after the purchase, in order to teach them about their spending.

Technology Stack:

    1. Android App and IOS app
    
    2. Tensorflow 


Challenges:

We have a shallow understanding of the economy so have to find and follow many economy related stuff to train our model
